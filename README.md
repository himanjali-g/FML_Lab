# Fundamentals of Machine Learning Lab 

This repository contains all the files and code I created as part of my **Fundamentals of Machine Learning Lab** course. It includes Jupyter notebooks, datasets, and Python scripts covering essential concepts and algorithms in machine learning.

##  Topics Covered

- Introduction to Machine Learning
- Data Preprocessing (Handling missing data, scaling, encoding)
- Supervised Learning:
  - Linear Regression
  - Logistic Regression
  - k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Decision Trees
- Unsupervised Learning:
  - K-Means Clustering
  - Hierarchical Clustering
- Model Evaluation Techniques:
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score
  - ROC Curve, AUC
- Hyperparameter Tuning (GridSearchCV)
- Dimensionality Reduction (PCA - if applicable)

##  Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy, Pandas
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
